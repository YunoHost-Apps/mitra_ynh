### Register a new domain and add it to YunoHost

- Your [Mitra](https://codeberg.org/silverpill/mitra) server requires a dedicated domain, so obtain one and add it using the YunoHost admin panel. **Domains -> Add domain**. As your server uses the full domain and is installed on the root, you can create a subdomain such as mywebsite.domain.tld. Don't forget to update your DNS records if you manage them manually.
